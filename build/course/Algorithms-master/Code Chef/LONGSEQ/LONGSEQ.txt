Chef has a number D containing only digits 0's and 1's. He wants to make the number to have all the digits same. For that, he will change exactly one digit, i.e. from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. If it is possible to make all digits equal (either all 0's or all 1's) by flipping exactly 1 digit then output "Yes", else print "No" (quotes for clarity)

Input

The first line will contain an integer T representing the number of test cases.

Each test case contain a number made of only digits 1's and 0's on newline

Output

Print T lines with a "Yes" or a "No", depending on whether its possible to make it all 0s or 1s or not. 

Constraints

Subtask #1: (40 points)
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ Length of the number D ≤ 50

Subtask #2: (60 points)
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ Length of the number D ≤ 105
Example

Input:
2
101
11
Output:
Yes
No
Explanation

Example case 1. In 101, the 0 can be flipped to make it all 1..

Example case 2. No matter whichever digit you flip, you will not get the desired string.
